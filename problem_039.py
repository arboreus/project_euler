#39) Integer right triangles
#If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.
#{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}
#For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

# Solution
from math import sqrt

# We are going to look for Pythagorean triples: a^2 + b^2 = c^2 where a < b < c
# We are going to use Dickson's method: find r,s,t in N where r^2 = 2*s*t, then x=r+s, y=r+t, z=r+s+t
P = 1000
